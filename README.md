# Splay-Tree
The self-adjusting binary search tree data structure known as a splay tree modifies its structure dynamically in response to elements that are inserted or accessed. Stated differently, the tree reconfigures itself on its own initiative, bringing frequently accessed or inserted items closer to the root node.
